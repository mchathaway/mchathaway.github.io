  I am currently working under Dr. Palandoken in his research group studying organic synthesis. We mainly 'focus on oxium either chemistry to modify biomolecules such as proteins for a variety of applications.
  I'm an active member in the chemistry fraternity on campus, Alpha Chi Sigma. Alpha Chi Sigma is a national professional and collegiate fraternety that focuses on the field of chemistry.
  As a Learning Assistant for the General Chemistry within the Chemistry Department at Cal Poly, I've become a more well-rounded student and gained a variety of knowledge that comes from being able to teach other students concepts from a field I'm passionate about.


### More Information

I have a variety of past experiences and skills that stem from work in food service back home in the Bay Area and on the Cal Poly Campus. I've worked in both a pizzeria and Jamba Juice, respectively different jobs but both have served to teach me skills relating to leadership, sanitation, how to keep a group of people motivated and oriented towards a commmon goal. Even though both jobs have brought their own challenges, both jobs improved my communication and flexibility.
